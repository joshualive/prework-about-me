      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I briefly picked up HTML & CSS in my teens while playing some online games which allowed for stylized personal pages. I enjoyed it, but had other interests at the time which I persured. In my current job, I work closely with our Engineering team, both FE & BE, escalting product issues with our web app. Digging into these issues renwed my interest in learning programming and exposed me to new roles within web dev that sparked my interest - particularly FE & QA.</p>
